            <p> I am Nishanth Shyam, a computer science student graduating from Newcastle University in 2019. Currently seeking summer 2018 
                internships.

            <p> I am currently on a yearlong internship at The Walt Disney Company working as an IT Analyst creating, maintaining and improving
                business applications focusing in EMEA but also cater for other regions.
                During my internship I have learnt a lot about front-end frameworks, specifically AngularJS and Angular 2/4. Learning about these
                front-end technologies has encouraged me to make this website which uses Angular 5. I have also used Angular Material during the
                internship and so have incorporated a lot of material design into this website.
